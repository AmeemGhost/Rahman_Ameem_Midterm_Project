                Since both comics company control such a huge share of the market, 
                they are natural competitors. At the same time, most of their superheroes 
                have their own legions of fans, and the rivalry between both universes is a c
                lassic subject of debate. However, in 1996, both companies did a curious collaboration, 
                publishing a crossover name “DC vs Marvel Comics”, where the main characters of each universe 
                fought in a series of duels, with interesting outcomes such as Superman defeating the 
                Hulk while Spider-Man defeated Superboy.
